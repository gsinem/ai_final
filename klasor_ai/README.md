# Rock-Paper-Scissors AI Game

This project implements a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with an AI agent that learns from player interactions. The AI uses a combination of pattern recognition and machine learning to improve its strategy over time.

## Features

- Interactive GUI using Pygame
- AI agent that learns from player patterns
- Score tracking and statistics
- Visual feedback for game outcomes

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Use the following controls:
- Press 'R' for Rock
- Press 'P' for Paper
- Press 'S' for Scissors
- Press 'Q' to quit

## AI Implementation

The AI agent uses a combination of:
- Pattern recognition to detect player tendencies
- Machine learning to predict player moves
- Adaptive strategy based on game history
